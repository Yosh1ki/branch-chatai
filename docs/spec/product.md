# Product Overview

## Purpose
Branches is a mind-map style multi-branching AI chat application for the web. It solves the problem of linear chat logs becoming hard to review when conversations drift by letting users split off-topic ideas into separate branches, keep the main discussion clean, and still visualize the overall structure through a tree-style UI and minimap.

## Target Users
- Engineers
- Consultants
- Researchers

## Success Criteria
- Users can branch any assistant response, show playful prompts when branching, and collapse messages that only display their auto-generated inline titles.
- The chat remains vertically readable while exposing the full tree through side branches plus a minimap that highlights the current location and supports jumping anywhere in the conversation.
- Each conversation automatically receives a language-aware title, and message-level inline titles are generated for collapsed views.
- Users can sign in with Google OAuth, choose between ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini per conversation, and upgrade from the Free plan (10 messages/day, all models) to the Pro plan (unlimited, Stripe billing).
