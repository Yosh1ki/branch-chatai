## Repository expectations (Template)

- Specs live in docs/spec/**. Rules live in docs/rules/**. Treat them as source of truth.
- If specs conflict, stop and report the conflict before coding.
- Keep changes small and reviewable. Prefer incremental PR-sized diffs.

## Repository Instructions

This repository is an AI-driven development template.

### Source of Truth
- Specifications are defined in `docs/spec/**`.
- Development rules are defined in `docs/rules/**`.
- Treat these documents as the single source of truth.

### Behavior Rules
- Do NOT infer missing requirements.
- If specifications are unclear or contradictory, stop and ask questions.
- Follow the rules before writing or modifying any code.

### Workflow
1. Read all relevant specs and rules.
2. Propose a brief plan.
3. Implement changes.
4. Report what was changed and why.
